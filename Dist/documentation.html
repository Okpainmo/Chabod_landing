              Chabod is built with different front end web development tools and
              this documentation guides you through as much as is needed to get
              a hand an them and customize Chabod into the portfolio website of
              your dream.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chabod is a straight forward portfolio website template. It's very
              much pre-built and thus, leaves out the stress of needing to know
              how to use any of its components like paddings, margins, buttons
              and etcetera. <br />
              The only components that might be necessary for users to know
              about, is the colour components. <br />
              Chabod comes with a black, white, and greyish color build. This
              simple colour pallete adds greatly to it's simplicity.
              <br />
              All color configurations can be found in the config partials of
              both the light and dark modes - that is, the
              <i>_light-mode-config.scss</i> file, the
              <i>_light-to-dark-mode-config.scss</i> file, the
              <i>_dark-mode-config.scss</i> file and the
              <i>_dark-to-light-mode-config.scss</i>
              file.

              Setting up your development environment to handle Chabod is pretty
              simple. Just lay a hand on any IDE(code editor) of you choice like
              VS Code or Atom, open up the Chabod folder in the code editor, and
              you are good to go.
            </p>
            <p>
              But please ensure that you make a back up copy of the template
              folder before beginnning any develpment process.

              Chabod is built with regular HTML5 markup and Bootstrap 5. This
              means a good knowledge of the Bootstrap framework will help
              greatly in handling and customizing Chabod HTML.

          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              Chabod is built with SASS. SASS is a CSS preprocessor - a tool
              that provides a better and more cool way to write styles. SASS
              styles are processed/compiled into regular CSS using different
              tools. In Chabod, Gulp.Js is the tool used in compiling SASS into
              regular CSS. It is the compiled SASS styles(CSS files) that are
              linked-to in all the head sections of the HTML files contained in
              Chabod.
            </p>
            <p>
              The SASS styling in this template follows the component based
              styling system, this means all the 6 different sections of Chabod
              are styled seperately in different files called partials. Apart
              from these 6 sections, other partials were created as well. These
              seperations make further development and maintenance to be much
              easier compared to working directly with the jammed CSS files.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feel free to work directly with the CSS files if you do not know
              how to work with SASS yet. You can find all the CSS files inside
              the "Styles" folder that is contained in the "Dist" folder in
              Chabod.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this template, SASS is processed into CSS using Gulp.Js. You
              can refer to the
              <a href="#to-gulp-section" class="custom-link">Gulp.Js section</a>
              below for more on SASS compilation. You do not need to bother a
              bit about SASS if Gulp is completely set up. So just set up Gulp,
              and go on with writing SASS - Gulp will automatically do the
              compiling as configured in the "gulp.js" script.
            </p>
            <p>
              But please, always remember to run the
              <span class="code">"gulp watch"</span> command in your command
              line interface or terminal during development, to ensure that gulp
              is watching for changes in any SASS file, so that it can compile
              the changes into regular CSS. If you fail to do so, SASS will not
              compile/process into CSS and thus your changes will not be
              effected.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find all the main SASS files and SASS partials in the
              "Sass" folder that is inside Chabod.

            <p>
              Chabod is built with a simple black, white and greyish color
              pallette. Using such a simple colour combination leaves out design
              complexities and also helps to ensure simplicity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both the dark and light modes of chabod are built with a black,
              white and a greyish color combination.
            </p>
            <p>
              The color configurations for Chabod are seperate inside the color
              configuration Sass partials. This seperations make handling
              colours during development to be much easier.
              <br />
              Considering the fact that the template comes in two colour modes,
              each mode needed its colour configurations and hence the colour
              setup had to be done seperately for both modes.
              <br />
              Just locate the colour cofiguration Sass file for the mode you
              want to work on(dark or light), then search for the item selector
              attribute('class', 'id' or any other type) that you want to work
              on, and fix things as you wish - its that simple.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find all the color configurations in the following SASS
              partial files.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The <i>_light-mode-config.scss file</i></li>
              <li>The <i>_light-to-dark-mode-config.scss file</i></li>
              <li>The <i>_dark-mode-config.scss file</i></li>
              gulp and the
              <li>The <i>_dark-to-light-mode-config.scss file</i></li>
              <br />
              You can also find few color styling inside the Chabod media query
              file - that is the
              <i>themequeries.scss file</i
              >, and
              <i>maybe</i>
              in other files as well.
            </ul>
            <p>
              Colour manipulation inside Chabod is done by using CSS variables
              (custom properties) and regular SASS variables.
              <br />
              Checkout all the above listed files to see the colour codes of the
              various colour variables.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <i>_dark-mode-config.scss file</i> and the
              <i>_light-mode-config.scss file</i> contain colour configurations
              for both the light and dark modes of Chabod respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the <i>_dark-to-light-mode-config.scss file</i> and the
              <i>_light-to-dark-mode-config.scss file</i> both contain colour
              configurations for switching colour modes using Javascript.

            <p>
              Chabod is built with the Bootstrap 5 framework. Bootstrap is a
              very popular HTML, CSS and Javascript framework. All the HTML
              files in Chabod contains CDN links to the Bootstrap framework for
              Bootstrap styles and all relevant scripts to get Bootstrap
              running.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that, as long as you are connected to the internet, you
              can just go ahead with customizing Chabod without needing any
              setup for Bootstrap.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you prefer working offline with local bootstrap files, go ahead
              and do the necessary downloads and then link to all the necessary
              files locally. The
              <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/"
                class="custom-link"
                >Bootstrap getting started</a
              >
              page should help you out with downloading all the necessary files
              for local development. So feel free to refer to it for all you
              will need to set up Bootstrap for local development.

          <h3 class="doc-section-header">Bootstrap Icons.</h3>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              The icon library that was used in building Chabod is bootstrap
              icons - another free and awesome life saver from Bootstrap.
              <br />
              similarly, No setup is actually needed to get bootstrap icons up
              and running because a CDN link was also used in the build. Just
              have internet access, and you are good to go.
              <br />
              The bootstrap icons CDN link can be found in the head sections of
              both the dark and light modes of Chabod HTML files.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bootstrap icons can easily be recorgnized by the
              <span class="code">"bi"</span> class attribute. Just locate the
              icon and inspect it using the browser developer tools or by
              looking directly into the codebase. If the icon contains a
              <span class="code">"bi"</span> class attribute, then its a
              bootstrap icon.

            <p>
              Ts particles is a Javascript tool for creating particle effects in
              websites. The moving particle effect on the home section of Chabod
              is done by Ts particles. Ts particles is a github fork of a
              similar javascript tool called Particles.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Chabod, you do not need any set up for ts particles. it's all
              set up already. Both the light and dark modes of Chabod contains
              customized configurations for ts particles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The particles effect on Chabod can be changed and customized to
              produce different ones as desired by users. Refer to the

        <div class="doc-section" id="to-gulp-section">
          <h3 class="doc-section-header">Gulp.Js.</h3>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              Gulp is a popular javascript tool for automating different
              development tasks like creating a live server, compiling SASS, CSS
              auto-prefixing, and etcetera.
            </p>
            <p>In this template, Gulp is the tool used for SASS compilation.</p>
            <p>
              Chabod comes with a <i>gulpfile.js script</i>. That leaves you
              with no special Gulp.js script to write. All you'll need to do, is
              to install gulp and all the required dependencies (gulp-sass,
              sass, and gulp auto-prefixer).
            </p>
            <p>
              Installing all the above listed dependencies only require a single
              command.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Simply run
                <span class="code">"npm install" </span>
                in the command line or terminal when inside the project folder,
                to install all the required dependencies and get gulp all set
                for compiling SASS.
                <br />
                Chabod comes with a <i>package.json</i> file which contains a
                list of all dependencies required to set up a complete workflow.
                Hence, simply running the
                <span class="code">"npm install" </span> command, directly
                installs all the dependencies listed in the
                <i>package.json</i> file.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With all of these all done, You are ready to start enjoying
              Gulp.Js on your workspace, and you are all set to start building
              with SASS as well. Isn't it all simple?

        <div class="doc-section" id="to-gmap-section">
          <h3 class="doc-section-header">Google Maps</h3>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              The Chabod theme is pre-built with an interface for embeding
              Google maps. However, The sales package(Your purchased pack) does
              not come preinstalled with Google maps. Here are some reasons why:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Every user needs to embed a google map view of their unique
              locations. This can only be done after purchase by the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Excluding Google maps from the purchased package, prevents
              third party issues. This simply means embeding Google maps on your
              Chabod website after purchase will only be an agreement between
              you and Google. Without any third party (developer) issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that Chabod was not built with an API key, and hence
              does not require any complex development work to set up a user
              location and have it show. Chabod is built to simply help users
              show their locations to site visitors by a simple embeding
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Embeding a Google map view of your location into the pre-built
              interface in Chabod is super easy.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First make a request to have your location added to Google maps.
                And wait until it is added.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once your location is added to google maps, Open Google maps and
                click on your location to have it's details displayed in the
                Google maps layout.
              </li>
              <li>
                Click the menu icon on the top right corner of the Google map
                interface.
              </li>
              <li>Select "Share or embed map"</li>

                >
              </li>
              <li>
                Paste the copied code into the
                <span class="code">"div"</span> element inside Chabod that has a
                <span class="code">"map-case"</span> class attribute.
                <br />
                The element with the "map-case" class attribute is in the
                contact section of the two main html files of the template.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove every attribute from the
                <span class="code">"iframe"</span> element in the pasted code
                leaving only the
                <span class="code">"src", "allowfullscreen"</span> and
                <span class="code">"loading"</span> attributes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add a
                <span class="code">"map-responsive"</span> class attribute to
                the iframe element. <br />
                The "map-responsive" class attribute is a CSS class that adds
                responsiveness to the prebuilt interface for embeding the map.
              </li>
              <li>
                Finally, Reload Chabod - and you'll see your google map location
                display beautifully and responsively inside Chabod.
