            <p>
              Chabod is an amazing portfolio website template built with the
              bootstrap framework. Chabod comes with 6 different sections to
              help sellers show their professional profile, while remaining as
              engaging as possible. Chabod is a simple single page static
              website, with pop-up features like: a project story pop-up for
              sharing project stories, and a blog pop-up for displaying blog
              stories.

              Chabod is built with different front end web development tools and
              this documentation guides you through as much as is needed to get
              a hand an them and customize Chabod into the portfolio website of
              your dream.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chabod is a straight forward portfolio website template. It's very
              well built and thus, leaves out the stress of needing to know how
              to use any of its components like paddings, margins, buttons and
              etcetera. <br />
              The only components that you might wish to know about, is the
              colour components. <br />
              Chabod comes with a black, white, and grey color build. This
              simple colour pallete adds greatly to it's simplicity.
              <br />
              All color configurations can be found in the config partial of
              both the light and dark modes - that is, the
              <i>"light-mode-config.scss" </i> &nbsp; file and the
              <i>"dark-mode-config.scss" </i>
              &nbsp; file).

              <a href="#" class="custom-link">colours section below</a> for more

            <p>
              Setting up your development environment to handle Chabod is pretty
              simple. Just lay a hand on any code editor of you choice like VS
              Code or Atom, open up the Chabod folder in the code editor, and we
              are good to go.

              Chabod is built with regular Html5 markup and Bootstrap 5. This
              means a good knowledge of the Bootstrap framework will help
              greatly in handling and customizing Chabod HTML.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="doc-section" id="to-style-section">
          <h3 class="doc-section-header">CSS and SASS.</h3>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              Chabod is built with SASS. SASS stand for "syntactically awesome
              stylesheet". SASS is a CSS preprocessor - it is a tool that
              provides a better and more cool way to write styles. SASS styles
              cannot be understood by your browser, as a result, SASS styles are
              processed into regular CSS which the browser understands. It is
              the processed SASS styles(CSS files) that are linked to in all the
              head section of the HTML files contained in Chabod.
            </p>
            <p>
              The SASS styling in this template follows the component based
              styling system, this means each section of Chabod is styled
              seperately thanks to SASS partials - all the 6 different sections
              of Chabod are styled seperately in different files called
              partials. These seperations make further development and
              maintenance to be much easier compared to working directly with
              the jammed CSS files directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feel free to work directly with the CSS files directly if you do
              not know how to work with SASS yet. You can find all the CSS files
              inside the "Styles" folder that is contained in the "Dist" folder
              in Chabod.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are different ways to process SASS into CSS. But in this
              template, SASS is processed into CSS using Gulp.Js. Refer to the
              <a href="#" class="custom-link">Gulp.Js section</a> below for more
              on SASS compilation/processing. You do not need to bother a bit
              about SASS if Gulp is completely set up. So just set up Gulp, and
              go on with writing SASS - Gulp will automatically do the
              processing as configured in the "gulp.js" script.
            </p>
            <p>
              But please, always remember to run the
              <span class="code">"gulp watch"</span> command in your command
              line interface or Terminal, to ensure that gulp is watching for
              changes in any SASS files, so that it can process it into regular
              CSS. If you fail to do so, SASS will not compile/process into CSS
              and thus your changes will not be effected.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find all the main SASS files and SASS partials in the
              "Sass" folder that is inside Chabod.

              With Chabod, you do not need any set up for ts particles. it's all
              set up already. Both the light and dark modes of Chabod contains
              customized configurations for ts particles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The particles effect on Chabod can be changed and customized to
              produce different particle effects of your choice. Refer to the
              <a href="#" class="custom-link">Ts particles website</a> for how
              to go about that.

            <p>
              Gulp is a popular javascript tool for automating different
              development tasks like creating a live server, processing SASS,
              CSS auto-prefixing, etc
            </p>
            <p>
              In this template, Gulp is used in SASS compilation and CSS
              auto-prefixing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chabod comes with a <i>gulpfile.js script</i>. That leaves you
              with no special Gulp.js script to write. All you'll need to do in
              to install gulp and all the required dependencies (gulp-sass,
              sass, and gulp auto-prefixer).
            </p>
            <p>
              Follow these simple steps to get your Gulp.js all set up and
              functioning.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Install gulp on your PC (You'll need to have node.js installed
                first).
              </li>
              <li>
                Initialize NPM in you project folder (the Chabod folder) by
                running the <span class="code">npm init</span> command in the
                command line or terminal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then run the following command on the command line or Terminal
                to install all the required dependencies to get gulp all set for
                compiling SASS and auto prefixing CSS -
                <span class="code"
                  >npm install --save-dev gulp-sass gulp-autoprefixer sass</span
                >
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With all of these all done, You are ready to start enjoying
              Gulp.Js on your workspace, and you are all set to start building
              with SASS as well.

              Chabod is built with a simple black, white and greyish color
              pallette. The reason for using such simple colour combinations is
              simply to avoid design complexities and also to ensure simplicity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both the dark and light modes of chabod are built with the same
              black, white and a greyish color combinations.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find all the color configurations in both the
              light-mode-config.scss file and the dark-mode-config.scss file for
              their respective modes.
